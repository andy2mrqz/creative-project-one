CS260 creative project

For this assignment, you should utilize your knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS (you must utilize all 3). Find something fun and create a new web page and prepare to present the page in class. You'll have a couple minutes (each) to present to a few other groups, and the top 5 in your class will present to the entire class. Make sure that your page doesn't require you to be there to explain it - because the TAs will be grading them without you there!
